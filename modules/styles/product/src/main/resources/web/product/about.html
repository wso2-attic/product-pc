<h2>About WSO2 Process Center</h2>
<p>Combining process design, implementation, analysis, and optimization, WSO2 Process Center (WSO2 PC)
 provides a complete, end-to-end solution for business process management (BPM). WSO2 PC forms the
 central component of WSO2’s BPM platform by providing centralized storage, governance,
 process monitoring/analytics, and process improvement support.
</p>
<p>
Meeting the requirements of all users in the BPM platform, it enables process users to discover
relevant processes and initiate automated processes; domain experts to design processes using
different formats; and process owners to monitor existing processes, analyze process history, and
identify possibilities of optimization.
</p>
<p>
 WSO2 PC offers a Process Explorer app as well as a Process Designer app to add/create new processes.
 It also leverages WSO2 Data Analytics Server to support monitoring/analysis and optimization features
 and supports events published via WSO2 Business Process Server or any integrated business process engine.
</p>
<h2>About WSO2 Carbon </h2>
<p>WSO2 Carbon is a component based Enterprise SOA platform. The
design of
WSO2 Carbon focuses on separating the key functionality of the SOA
platform
into separate pluggable Carbon components that can be mixed and
matched, like
customizable building blocks. This allows you to add only the
functionality
you need to start up, and continue to add product capabilities
as your
requirements grow. This helps a business to quickly adapt to
changes.</p>
<p>OSGi is used as the underlying core modularization technology
to build the
Carbon platform. The Carbon framework is shipped with Eclipse Equinox
by
default, but can be supported on Spring dm Server, Felix or Knoplerfish
if
required. The OSGi technology even allows you to write your business
functionality as an OSGi component and deploy it in the existing Carbon
platform. </p>
<p> For a quick start on using the WSO2 Carbon
platform, the Carbon components are pre-assembled into the following
products: </p>

deploying them in a preferred architecture. Now WSO2 Carbon has the P2 based provisioning support as
well. Please visit <a href="http://wso2.org/library">http://wso2.org/library</a> for more
information. </p>
<p>The WSO2 Carbon platform gives maximum flexibility to adapt
the middleware
to your enterprise architecture, rather than adapt your architecture to
the
middleware. </p>
